# Chapter 3

Asynchronous and Synchronous.

In many programming languages, you write a code and each line is executed synchronously.

But some languages you can do multiple actions at the same time.

Think about a website. Your browser can fetch some data fra backend and load some images on the page and you can interact with the page by clicking around and do stuff without waiting for browser to finish the data to load in the background.

So it is important to be able to do multiple tasks and not blocking the user.

With help of Promise and Async function.
