  <h1>JavaScript</h1>

  <p>
    A book for users who wants to learn JavaScript without all the extra stuff.
    Some parts of JavaScript is not good and can make you write code that is
    buggy or hard to debug.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this book I'll try to avoid teaching you those parts so you can focus on
    writing only good code :)
